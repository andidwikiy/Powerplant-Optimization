# Powerplant-Optimization
In this project there are 2 optimization project. 
- [The first project](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Powerplant-Optimization/blob/1ba9b66214cbca0e5e8d23c85a3a4f3a5c439b4c/Optimization_Problem/optimization1.py) is a straightforward optimization task involving thermal generators, which was addressed using PuLP in Python. The optimal solution is provided [here](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Powerplant-Optimization/blob/1e383db5fc4a8bd96528e61a9761b827336bcad9/Optimization_Problem/Result1.pdf).
- [The second project](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Powerplant-Optimization/tree/3e9a6fc84a4ecda7ea63db24b45c1643757b71d6/Optimization_Problem_2) is a more complex optimization tast where the goal is to choose not only between certain types of thermal generator, but also with an addition of renewable sources such as wind and pv. Because of the complexity, this problem was solved and coded using GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) which can run the code faster. There are 3 scenarios in this project ([scenario1](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Powerplant-Optimization/blob/3e9a6fc84a4ecda7ea63db24b45c1643757b71d6/Optimization_Problem_2/ScenarioA.gms),[scenario2](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Powerplant-Optimization/blob/3e9a6fc84a4ecda7ea63db24b45c1643757b71d6/Optimization_Problem_2/ScenarioB.gms),[scenario3](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Powerplant-Optimization/blob/3e9a6fc84a4ecda7ea63db24b45c1643757b71d6/Optimization_Problem_2/ScenarioB2.gms)) and the result can be seen [here](https://github.com/andidwikiy/Powerplant-Optimization/blob/3e9a6fc84a4ecda7ea63db24b45c1643757b71d6/Optimization_Problem_2/Results.pdf).
